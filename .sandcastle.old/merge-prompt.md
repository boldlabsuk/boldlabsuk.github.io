# TASK

Merge the following branches into the current branch:

{{BRANCHES}}

Before merging, read `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, and the relevant files under `docs/agents/` so conflict resolutions and issue comments use this repository's guidance and vocabulary.

For each branch:

1. Run `git merge <branch> --no-edit`
2. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them intelligently by reading both sides and choosing the correct resolution
3. After resolving conflicts, run `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` to verify everything works
4. If any check fails, fix the issues before proceeding to the next branch

After all branches are merged, run `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` again. Make a single commit summarizing the merge only after those checks pass.

# CLOSE ISSUES

Only after all merged work has passed `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build`, close each issue using the following command:

`gh issue close <ID> --comment "Completed by Sandcastle"`

Here are all the issues:

{{ISSUES}}

Once you've merged everything you can, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
